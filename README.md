After making some fire code. you gotta commit it,so if you break something
you have it fall back on. This happens in three steps:

- adding your files (staging): git add <filename> or git add . (for everything)
- commiting your changes (this will only create the commit in your local copy): git commit -m "your message here"
- Last step is to propogate your genes (shit code) to everyone else: git push

git add .
git commit -m "your message here"
git push
